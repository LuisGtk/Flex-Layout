# Flex-Layout

I always had trouble when starting of with flexbox so I chose to just do simple prjects just so I can always have my own work to go back to if I were to foget something or need a reminder. This layout is mobile friendly and I want to make sure I start to include that in every project moving forward since it is an important thing to include when developing applications.

Tech: HTML,Tailwind.CSS,JSX,Next.js
